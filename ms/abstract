Title: Discovery and Characterization of RR Lyrae Variable Stars from Sparsely Sampled Light Curves Using Parsimonious Models

Abstract: Variable stars observed in multiband time domain surveys are an example of functional data. Estimating parameters and classifying these functions is important for a variety of science goals. These tasks are especially challenging when the functions are sparsely sampled. In this work we present a new model for RR Lyrae variable stars constructed using Stripe 82 SDSS data. The resulting model is parsimonious (few free parameters) and computationally efficient to fit to new light curves, making it well suited for finding RR Lyrae in surveys such as Pan-STARRS and DES. We demonstrate the ability of the model to estimate periods and classify sparsely sampled RR Lyrae and discuss ongoing work to use RR Lyrae as tracers of Milky Way halo structure.



Title: Near Field Cosmology with RR Lyrae Variable Stars

Abstract: RR Lyrae (RRL) are a class of periodic variable stars. Discovery of RRL in the Milky Way halo provides evidence for existence of satellite galaxies. Thus RRL may be used to solve the missing satellites problem in near field cosmology in which the number of observed Milky Way satellites is smaller than that predicted by cosmological simulations. Ongoing and upcoming multi--filter surveys such as Pan-STARRS, DES, and LSST will produce large time domain data sets of objects in the Milky Way halo. Finding and characterizing RRL in these data sets is challenging, especially for Pan-STARRS and DES which have sparse temporal coverage. We present a new model for RRL stars constructed using densely time sampled RRL found by SDSS in Stripe 82. The resulting model is parsimonious (few free parameters) and computationally efficient to fit to new light curves, making it well suited for surveys such as Pan-STARRS and DES. We demonstrate the ability of the model to estimate periods for RRL detected by Pan-STARRS and discuss how the model can be used to find RRL among large sets of light curves using goodness-of-fit statistics.
