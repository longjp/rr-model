Title: Computationally Efficient Models for RR Lyrae Variable Stars

Abstract: RR Lyrae variable stars may be used to find Milky Way satellite galaxies and trace the location of halo substructures such as stellar clouds and streams in three-dimensional space. Thus RR Lyrae offer the potential to solve the ''missing satellites problem'' in which simulations based on the Lambda-CDM cosmological model predict many more dwarf galaxies in the Local Group than are observed. Ongoing and upcoming multi--filter surveys such as PanSTARRS, DES, and LSST will produce large time domain data sets of objects in the halo. Finding and characterizing RR Lyrae in these data sets is challenging, especially for surveys such as PanSTARRS and DES which have sparse temporal coverage. We present a new model for RR Lyrae light curves. The model is constructed using (relatively) densely time sampled RR Lyrae found by SDSS in Stripe 82. The resulting model is parsimoneous (few free parameters) and computationally efficient to fit to new light curves, making it well suited for surveys such as PanSTARRS and DES. We demonstrate the ability of the model to estimate periods for RR Lyrae detected by PanSTARRS and discuss how the model can be used to find RR Lyrae among large sets of light curves using goodness-of-fit statistics.
