    "This model assumes all RR Lyrae share a common shape by band and that RR Lyrae are strictly periodic functions. These assumptions are an approximation. For example, RR Lyrae which undergo the Blazhko effect are not strictly periodic functions. Rather than construct a perfectly accurate model, the goal is to construct a model with few free parameters that provides a better approximation to RR Lyrae variation than existing methods. For example a simple sinusoid model fit to 5 filters has a total of 16 free parameters (5 means, 5 amplitude, 5 phases, and 1 frequency) while providing only a very rough approximation to the steep rise and slow decline in brighness observed in RR Lyrae light curves. In contrast this model provides a significantly better approximation while fitting for 5 free parameters (or 4 if light curves are dust corrected). We provide empirical evidence to support these claims in our results section. "
