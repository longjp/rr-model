## downloads all data to raw/
Rscript download.R
## takes files in raw/, cleans them, moves to clean/
any_R_file_other_than_download.R

======= description of files
== raw/ contains raw data
   - automatically downloaded by running download.R
   - see below for locations it was acquired from
== clean/ data after cleaning, generally .RData files with tms for
   lightcurves and periods
== ../common/funcs.R functions used for processing raw data


======= files in raw/ folder, after running download.R
