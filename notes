==== accomplished so far
== simulations with panstarrs cadence
 - using panstarrs cadence unioned into single band and simulating sines,
   sine model gets ~ 97% of periods correct ****
 - accuracy was not affected by using / not using errors
 - accuracy goes down to about 70% if use sawtooth function to simulate
 - conclusion: 97% is probably quite favorable, but does suggest that 
   accurate period estimation is possible

== newton method
 - used newton method to find phase in sawtooth model (period fixed), see
   sim.R. newton method is faster and nearly as accurate as gridsearch. gets
   stuck in local minima sometimes
- rss as function of phase is somewhat complicated. it is a piecewise quadratic (convex function). this is clear when there are few observations

==== goals
== simulations with newton and sawtooth
  - rerun simulations **** simulating from and fitting a sawtooth
    GOAL: have algorithm be fast (about same speed as GLS) because using
    newton AND have algorithm be accurate ~ 97%

== panstarrs data
  - estimate sawtooth functions from SDSS and compare GLS with sawtooths
    for Panstarrs data. branimir gave ground truth.
    GOAL: see some improvement in period estimation accuracy.


= to do
- newton on panstarrs is not converging, sine model does better even
  when data is generated from sawtooth. need to investigate algorithm
  possitibilites for better performance include: NN > 1, random phase sampling
  - refine grid near optimum
  - get all simulated light curves which did not get period right for 
    saw model
  - sometimes newton returns error larger than rss with amp=0, why?
    can this be fixed?
