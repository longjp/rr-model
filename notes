==== accomplished so far
== simulations with panstarrs cadence
 - using panstarrs cadence unioned into single band and simulating sines,
   sine model gets ~ 97% of periods correct ****
 - accuracy was not affected by using / not using errors
 - accuracy goes down to about 70% if use sawtooth function to simulate
 - conclusion: 97% is probably quite favorable, but does suggest that 
   accurate period estimation is possible

== newton method
 - used newton method to find phase in sawtooth model (period fixed), see
   sim.R. newton method is faster and nearly as accurate as gridsearch. gets
   stuck in local minima sometimes
- rss as function of phase is somewhat complicated. it is a piecewise quadratic (convex function). this is clear when there are few observations




==== goals
== simulations with newton and sawtooth
  - rerun simulations **** simulating from and fitting a sawtooth
    GOAL: have algorithm be fast (about same speed as GLS) because using
    newton AND have algorithm be accurate ~ 97%
       - ACHIEVED: 95% of lcs within 1% of truth (using NN=5)

== panstarrs data
  - estimate sawtooth functions from SDSS and compare GLS with sawtooths
    for Panstarrs data. branimir gave ground truth.
    GOAL: see some improvement in period estimation accuracy.
       - ACHIEVED: 45% of lcs within 1% of truth

== to do

=== do the following three simple steps (1 day)
- double check for coding errors in algorithm
   DONE: could not find any
- get rid of rr lyrae c (reduce period range to rrlyrae ab)
   DONE: NN=10, 0.1% accuracy now up to 55%
- return top 5 periods
   DONE: NN=10, 0.1% accuracy now up to 80%

=== bigger adjustments
- more accurate lc shape (2 days)
- could algorithm be converging to local min / max (2 days)
  - NN = 5 with 2 (or more) chains
- ridge penalty on amplitude, prior on period (1 day)

=== after doing all these we require
- 90% of lcs have a top 5 estimate within .1% of truth

If we cannot achieve this, we quit.



== to do
- run regsse phase regrestration (equation 7.1 of fda) on light curves and examine plots
- estimate cc from these new plot, is it less than old cc?
   - if so run algorithm again with new cc

- papers
   - algorithm + results on panstarrs (astronomy paper)
   - classification of rr lyrae in 

- learning
   - assessing model fit
   - quasi-newton implementation
   - code in c
   - posterior approximations
