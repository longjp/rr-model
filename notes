==== accomplished so far
== simulations with panstarrs cadence
 - using panstarrs cadence unioned into single band and simulating sines,
   sine model gets ~ 97% of periods correct ****
 - accuracy was not affected by using / not using errors
 - accuracy goes down to about 70% if use sawtooth function to simulate
 - conclusion: 97% is probably quite favorable, but does suggest that 
   accurate period estimation is possible

== newton method
 - used newton method to find phase in sawtooth model (period fixed), see
   sim.R. newton method is faster and nearly as accurate as gridsearch. gets
   stuck in local minima sometimes
- rss as function of phase is somewhat complicated. it is a piecewise quadratic (convex function). this is clear when there are few observations

==== goals
== simulations with newton and sawtooth
  - rerun simulations **** simulating from and fitting a sawtooth
    GOAL: have algorithm be fast (about same speed as GLS) because using
    newton AND have algorithm be accurate ~ 97%
       - ACHIEVED: 95% of lcs within 1% of truth (using NN=5)

== panstarrs data
  - estimate sawtooth functions from SDSS and compare GLS with sawtooths
    for Panstarrs data. branimir gave ground truth.
    GOAL: see some improvement in period estimation accuracy.


= to do
- prove that projecting onto amp > 0 will make beta0 be mean(m)
- more accurate period estimate:
   - NN > 1 (easy to try)
   - force algorithm to get lower rss at newton update
   - try several phases simultaneously

- newton on panstarrs is not converging, sine model does better even
  when data is generated from sawtooth. need to investigate algorithm
  possitibilites for better performance include: NN > 1, random phase sampling
     - get a few lcs that have period estimated incorrectly with saw
       and test them in sim4.R
     - have NN phases at each freq, if phases get close OR amp = 0 OR 
       newton goes uphill, select a random new phase.
     - refine grid near optimum
     - get all simulated light curves which did not get period right for 
       saw model

     - when amp = 0, is it necessary to do projection since we choose
       a random phase anyway?
     - if amp=0 then beta0 is just mean of mags, right?



     - how well does algorithm do just selecting random phases? (at 1% accuracy, get 40% correct, ~ 65% with newton)
